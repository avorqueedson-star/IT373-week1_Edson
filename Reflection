In doing this Django project, I faced several challenges that I could not easily solve on my own. Luckily, I had a friend who helped me along the way. 
She guided me whenever I got confused about the commands and even allowed me to borrow her laptop so I could continue working on the activity. 
At first, I was really struggling with errors in the command prompt and connecting my project to GitHub. I felt stuck and thought I could not move forward, but with my friendâ€™s support, along with the video and
PDF guide, I was able to overcome those difficulties in terms for this activity.

Secondly, in part of the process involved checking the Python version and installing, activating the virtual environment (venv), 
verifying the Django version, and running the server to see if everything worked correctly. Setting up the Git remote and pushing my project online was also tricky, but it gave me a better understanding of how coding projects are managed and shared.

Lastly,  I learned that from this experience is that asking for help is not a weakness but a way to learn more effectively. 
Borrowing her laptop and working together made the activity less stressful and more collaborative. 
This project taught me the value of patience, support, and teamwork in learning. Even in technical tasks like coding, relationships and cooperation play a big role in success.
